HELLO THERE! 

This is a mini-repo of the Mobile-First resources I utilized at the last Meetup for Mobile First. I've included
the powerpoint, a pdf version for phones, and the code samples as well. I will probably add more to this eventually..


Purpose:
---------
Cover basics of mobile first principals, beginning with establishing the reasoning behind mobile first principals, continuing into basic styling techniques, and then moving into SASS practices in easy to digest samples along with helpful mobile-first links.


Setup:
---------
1. Open powerpoint
2. Absorb knowledge
3. Share
